<!-- [Overview of final projects](https://cmu-ids-2020.github.io/) -->

This course, as described in the catalog, examines _important social, legal, and historical contexts of information and information technologies, and explores significant social, legal, and moral questions that surround those technologies._

To this end, we will discuss three primary themes throughout this course. Namely, information and information technologies:
- have social, legal, ethical, and historical **contexts**
- are socially, legally, ethically, or historically **designed**,
- and have social, legal, or ethical **ramifications**

By the end of the semester, you will be able to **understand, evaluate, and communicate** about the _context around, design of, and ramifications of_ information and information systems.
