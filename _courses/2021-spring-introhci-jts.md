<!-- [Overview of final projects](https://cmu-ids-2020.github.io/) -->

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to **principles** and **applications** of human-computer interaction (HCI), _a user-centered approach to designing and evaluating interactive computer systems_. This interdisciplinary approach combines principles, methods, techniques, and tools from computer science,  social  and  cognitive  sciences,  and  interaction  design.  HCI  principles and methods are practiced in the design and evaluation of most software and physical products and services and greatly impact all areas of human life that involve  interactive  technology  such  as  communication  and  collaboration  in critical domains such as education and healthcare.
